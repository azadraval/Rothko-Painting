# Rothko Painting Project

This is my Rothko-inspired painting project, created as part of the freeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design certification. I built an abstract digital painting that mimics Mark Rothko's distinctive style using CSS.

## Project Overview

The Rothko Painting project helped me explore the CSS box model in depth. By manipulating div elements with specific styling properties, I created a colorful abstract composition reminiscent of Rothko's famous rectangular color field paintings.

## What I Learned

Through this project, I practiced:
- Working with the CSS box model in detail
- Understanding margins, padding, and borders
- Using CSS filters for visual effects
- Implementing box-shadow properties
- Applying color theory in web design
- Creating layered elements with precise positioning
- Using CSS transform properties
- Working with opacity and blur effects

## Technologies Used

- HTML5
- CSS3

## Project Structure

- `index.html` - The basic HTML structure with nested div elements
- `styles.css` - The CSS file that transforms simple divs into an artistic composition

## Design Elements

The painting features:
- A frame-like container
- Multiple colored rectangles with soft edges
- Subtle shadow effects for depth
- Carefully chosen color combinations
- Blurred boundaries mimicking Rothko's style

This project taught me how seemingly simple elements can be transformed into art through CSS. I gained a deeper understanding of how the box model works and how visual effects can create mood and dimension in web design.
